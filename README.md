# Introduction

Our project involves comparing two algorithms that can solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty. Sudokus are number puzzles that involve filling a 9 x 9 grid with digits while respecting three rules. First, every column must contain the numbers 1 to 9, without repetitions. Second, every row must contain the numbers 1 to 9, without repetitions. Lastly, nine blocks (nonets as they are commonly called), that are of size 3 x 3 throughout the entire grid, must contain the digits 1 to 9, without repetitions. These Sudoku puzzles vary in difficulty, depending on the number of initial digits given in the grid. The challenge of our project, as a result, consists of designing two Sudoku solving algorithms, a backtracking approach and a more rule-based constrained approach. We hypothesize that, in terms of time, the backtracking algorithm would be more efficient in solving many more Sudokus. The rule-based approach, however, would enable us to analyze how much time a more human-like approach would take in solving these numerical puzzles.
